                    Todayâ€™s web is highly interactive, dynamic, and personalized. Modern websites are often powered
                    by frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue.js, or Angular, and many are backed by databases
                    and APIs.

                    Technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript enable developers to build sophisticated user
                    experiences that work across a wide range of devices and platforms.

                    At its core, the Web operates on a client-server model. Web browsers act as clients that request
                    resources (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) from web servers. These servers respond by
                    sending the requested content, which the browser then renders into a visual web page.
